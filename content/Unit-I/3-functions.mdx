- For complex problems our goal is to divide the task into smaller and simpler tasks during the algorithm design.
- A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. 
- A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action.
- Functions provide better modularity for our application and a high degree of code reusing.
