## Find the smallest of given two numbers
```
Step 1 : Start
Step 2 : Read values of two numbers, A and B
Step 3 : Check whether A is less than B, if the condition is true then  goto step 3.1 else goto step 3.2
      Step 3.1:print A is the smallest number
      Step 3.2: print B is the smallest number
Step 4 : Stop
```

## Check whether the given number is three digit number or not
```
Step 1 : Start
Step 2 : Read the number, A
Step 3 : Check whether the given number is greater than 99 and less than 1000, if yes then goto step 3.1 otherwise goto step 3.2
      Step 3.1: Print the message “The number is a three digit number”
      Step 3.2: Print the message “The number is not a three digit number”
Step 4 : Stop
```

## Check whether the given year is Leap Year or not.
```
Step 1 : Start
Step 2 : Read the value of the year
Step 3: Check whether the given year is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100, if yes goto 3.1 otherwise goto 3.2
           	Step 3.1: print the message “It is Leap year” 
			Step 3.2: Check whether the given year is divisible by 400, if yes goto 3.2.1 otherwise goto 3.2.2
 				Step 3.2.1: print the message “It is Leap year”
	 			Step 3.2.2: print the message “It is not Leap year”

```

## Calculate purchase amount to be paid after discount. Consider 10 % discount for the Sale amount above 1000.
```
Step 1: Start 
Step 2: Read price
Step 3: Read quantity
Step 4: Calculate amount as 
	Purchase Amount = price * quantity
Step 5: Check whether amount is greater than or equal to 1000, if yes then goto step 5.1 otherwise goto step 6
	Step 5.1: Calculate discount as 
		    	Discount Amount = Purchase Amount * 0.10
	Step 5.2 : Calculate amount to be paid
			Paid Amount= amount - discount	
Step 6: Print the value of amount
Step 7: Stop
```
## Find whether the given number is positive or negative
```
Step 1: Start 
Step 2: Read the number
Step 3: Check whether number is greater than or equal to zero, if yes then goto step 3.1 otherwise goto step 3.2
	Step 3.1: Print the message "number is Positive"
	Step 3.2: Print the message "number is Negative"
Step 4: Stop
```



## Find the given number is odd or even 
```
Step 1: Start 
Step 2: Read the number
Step 3: Calculate the remainder as
	remainder = number % 2
Step 3: Check whether remainder is equal to zero, if yes then goto step 3.1 otherwise goto step 3.2
	Step 3.1: Print the message "number is Even"
	Step 3.2: Print the message "number is ODD"
Step 4: Stop
```
## Identify whether the given number is smallest among three numbers 
```
Step 1: Start 
Step 2: Read the num1, num2 and num3
Step 3: Check whether num1 is less than num2 and also num1 is less than num3, if yes then goto step 3.1  Otherwise check whether num2 is less than num3, 
	If yes, goto step 3.2 otherwise goto 3.3
	Step 3.1: Print the message "num1 is lesser"
	Step 3.2: Print the message "num2 is lesser"
	Step 3.3: Print the message "num3 is lesser"
Step 4: Stop
```

## Read total shopping amount purchased in the shop, and then apply the discount as per the following discount criteria, then find and print the final amount that has to be paid by the customer after subtracting the discount amount:

| Shopping Amount | Discount % |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| 5000 and Above	|  25%    |
| 1000 - 4999 	|  10%    |
| Below		|  5%     |




```
Step 1: Start 
Step 2: Read shopping amount
Step 3: Check whether shopping amount is greater than or equal to 5000, if yes then goto step 3.1. Otherwise check whether amount is greater than or equal to 1000 and less than 4999,  If yes, goto step 3.2 otherwise goto 3.3
	Step 3.1: Calculate discount as 
		        discount = shopping amount * 0.25
	Step 3.2: Calculate discount as 
		        discount = shopping amount * 0.10
	Step 3.3: Calculate discount as 
		        discount = shopping amount * 0.05
Step 6: Calculate the final amount
		Final amount = shopping amount - discount
Step 7: Display the Final amount
Step 8: Stop
```
