## Print first N natural numbers
```
Step 1 : Start
Step 2 : Initialize the value of i as 1
Step 3: Read the value of a number, N
Step 4 : Check the condition i less than or equal to N, if the condition is true goto step 4.1 else goto step 5
         Step 4.1: Print i and increment the value of i by 1
         Step 4.2: Repeat the Step 4 until the condition is true
Step 5 : Stop
```

## Print Sum of first N natural numbers

```
Step 1 : Start
Step 2 : Initialize the value of i as 1 and sum as 0
Step 3: Read the value of a number, N
Step 4 : Check the condition i less than or equal to N, if the condition is true goto step 4.1 else goto step 5
         Step 4.1 calculate sum=sum+i 
         Step 4.2: Increment the value of i by 1 and repeat the Step 4 until the condition is true
Step 5 : print sum
Step 6 : Stop
```

## Print odd numbers from 1 to N
```
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Initialize the value of i as 1
Step 3: Read the value of a number, N
Step 4: Check the condition i less than or equal to N, if the condition is true goto step 4.1 else 
            goto step 5
	Step 4.1: print i and increment the value of i by 2
	Step 4.2: Repeat the Step 4 until the condition is true
Step 5: Stop 
```

## Print multiplication table of a given number
```
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Initialize the value of i as 1
Step 3: Read the value of a number, N
Step 4: Check the condition i less than or equal to 10, if the condition is true goto step 4.1 else 
            goto step 5
	Step 4.1: Calculate res=N*i 
	Step 4.1: print N*i=res and increment the value of i by 1
	Step 4.2: Repeat the Step 4 until the condition is true
Step 5: Stop
```

## Print reverses of the given number
```
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Initialize the value of   reverse as 0 and reminder as 0
Step 3: Read any number, N
Step 4: Check the condition N is not equal to zero, if the condition is true goto step 4.1 else 
                         goto step 5
Step 4.1: Calculate reminder = N %10
Step 4.2: Calculate reverse = reverser*10+ reminder
Step 4.3: Calculate N=N/10 and repeat the Step 4 until the condition is true
Step 5: print reverse
Step 6: Stop
```
## To find factorial of a given number
```
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Initialize the value of i as 1 and fact as 1
Step 3: Read the value of a number, num
Step 4: Check the condition num equal to 0, if the condition is true goto step 4.1 else goto step 4.2
	Step 4.1: print “Factorial of 0 is 1”
	Step 4.2: Check the condition i less than or equal to num, if the condition is true goto 
                             step 4.2.1 else goto step 4.3
		Step 4.2.1: Calculate factorial as, fact=fact*i and increment the value of i by 1
		Step 4.2.2: Repeat the Step 4.2 until the condition is true
Step 4.3: print fact
Step 5: Stop
```
