Pseudo code is an informal way of programming description that does not require any strict programming language syntax. It is an outline of a program written in a form that can be easily converted into real programming statements.

```
A pseudocode to add two numbers and display the results:
	
    READ num1,num2
	Result=num1+num2
	PRINT result.

```

## Basic Guidelines for Writing Pseudocode
- Statements should be written in English and programming language independent.
- Steps must be understandable and it should not be difficult
- Each instruction should be written in a separate line
- Keywords must be capitalized
- Each set of instruction must be written from top to bottom
- It should be easy for translating the design into code in any programming language.

## Advantages
- Pseudocode is language independent, it can be used by most of the programmers
- It becomes easy to develop a program.
- It is compact and easy to modify.

## Disadvantages
- It does not provide visual representation of the program logic.
- No standard rules for writing pseudocode.
- It is not used to understand the flow of the program control.
