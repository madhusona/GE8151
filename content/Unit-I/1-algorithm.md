## Algorithm

An Algorithm is defined as a set of steps for solving a particular problem in a finite amount of time. It is a good software engineering practice to design algorithms before we write a program.

```algorithm
Step 1: Start
Step 2: READ num1, num2
Step 3: result = num1+num2
Step 4: DISPLAY result
Step 5: Stop
```

## Qualities of an Algorithm
- **Accuracy**: Algorithm should provide accurate result
- **Memory**: It should require minimum computer memory
- **Time**: It should take finite amount of time.
- **Sequence**: The procedure of an algorithm must be in sequential form

## Characteristics/Properties of Algorithm
**Input**: All the algorithms should have some input. The logic of the algorithm should work on this input to give the desired result.<br />
**Finiteness**: An algorithm must always terminate after a finite number of steps.<br />
**Definiteness**: Every step of the algorithm should be clear and not any ambiguity.<br />
**Effectiveness**: Every step in the algorithm should be easy to understand and can be implemented using any programming language.<br />
**Output**: At least one output should be produced from the algorithm based on the input given.<br />

## Advantage
- It is a stepwise description of a solution, which makes easy to understand.
- It is not dependent on any programming language.
- It is easier for programmer to convert into an actual program.

## Disadvantage
- It is difficult to show branching and looping statements.
- It is time consuming, algorithm needs to be developed first which is then converted to program.
