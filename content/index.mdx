## Objectives
- To know the basics of algorithmic problem solving
- To read and write simple Python programs.To develop Python programs with conditionals and loops.
- To define Python functions and call them.
- To use Python data structures –- lists, tuples, dictionaries.

## UNIT I ALGORITHMIC PROBLEM SOLVING 
Algorithms, building blocks of algorithms (statements, state, control flow, functions), notation
(pseudo code, flow chart, programming language), algorithmic problem solving, simple strategies
for developing algorithms (iteration, recursion). Illustrative problems: find minimum in a list, insert a
card in a list of sorted cards, guess an integer number in a range, Towers of Hanoi.

## UNIT II DATA, EXPRESSIONS, STATEMENTS 
Python interpreter and interactive mode; values and types: int, float, boolean, string, and list;
variables, expressions, statements, tuple assignment, precedence of operators, comments;
modules and functions, function definition and use, flow of execution, parameters and arguments;
Illustrative programs: exchange the values of two variables, circulate the values of n variables,
distance between two points.

## UNIT III CONTROL FLOW, FUNCTIONS
Conditionals: Boolean values and operators, conditional (if), alternative (if-else), chained
conditional (if-elif-else); Iteration: state, while, for, break, continue, pass; Fruitful functions: return
values, parameters, local and global scope, function composition, recursion; Strings: string slices,
immutability, string functions and methods, string module; Lists as arrays. Illustrative programs:
square root, gcd, exponentiation, sum an array of numbers, linear search, binary search.

## UNIT IV LISTS, TUPLES, DICTIONARIES 
Lists: list operations, list slices, list methods, list loop, mutability, aliasing, cloning lists, list
parameters; Tuples: tuple assignment, tuple as return value; Dictionaries: operations and
methods; advanced list processing – list comprehension; Illustrative programs: selection sort,
insertion sort, mergesort, histogram.


## UNIT V FILES, MODULES, PACKAGES 
Files and exception: text files, reading and writing files, format operator; command line arguments,
errors and exceptions, handling exceptions, modules, packages; Illustrative programs: word count,
copy file.
