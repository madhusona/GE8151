A value is one of the basic things a program works with, like a letter or a number.

** Example:**
2, 42.0 , 'Hello'. 

These values belong to different types: 2 is an ** integer **, 42.0 is a ** floating-point number **, and 'Hello' is a ** string **

## type

Type function is used to find the type of a value.
- integers belong to the type int
- strings belong to str
- floating-point numbers belong to float

```
>>> type(2)
<class 'int'>
>>> type(42.0)
<class 'float'>
>>> type('Hello, World!')
<class 'str'>
```
- '2' and '42.0' are look like numbers, but they are enclosed in quotation 
marks so it belongs to type strings.

```
>>> type('2')
<class 'str'>
>>> type('42.0')
<class 'str'>
```
