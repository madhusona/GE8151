## Arithmetic Operators:
Arithmetic Operaor is Used to perform common mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, etc.

| Operator                  | Description                   | Example |
| -----------               | -----------                   | ------- |
|+ addition|Add two operands|a+b|
| - Subtraction      |    Subtracts right hand operand from left hand operand.     | a-b |
| * Multiplications|   Multiplies values on either side of the operator      |  a*b|
|/ Division|Divide left operand by the right one (always results into float)     |  a/b|
|% Modulus|Divides left hand operand by right hand operand and returns remainder|a % b|    
|// Floor Division|Floor division - division that results into whole number adjusted to the left in the number line|  a//b
|**	Exponent| left operand raised to the power of right| a**b|

```
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
print("addition ",a+b)
print("Subtraction ",a-b)
print("Multiplication ",a*b)
print("Division ",a/b)
print("Floor Division",a//b)
print("Modulo ",a%b)
print("Exponentiation ",a**b)
print("Floor division negative number",-3//2)
```

** Output **
```
addition  5
Subtraction  1
Multiplication  6
Division  1.5
Floor Division 1
Modulo  1
Exponentiation  9
Floor division negative number -2
```
