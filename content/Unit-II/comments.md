metaDescription: "Python - Comments"

A comment is a piece of program text that the interpreter ignores but that provides useful documentation to programmers. Comments start with the # symbol

** Example:**
```
# compute the percentage of the hour that has elapsed
percentage = (minute * 100) / 60
```

In this case, the comment appears on a line by itself. We can also put comments at the end of a line:
```
percentage = (minute * 100) / 60 # percentage of an hour
```
