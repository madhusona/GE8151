Conditional statements give the ability to check conditions and change the behavior of the program accordingly.

## Syntax:
```
if boolean expression:
	statements
```
- The boolean expression after if is called the condition. If it is true, then the if indented statement gets executed. If it is false, nothing happens.

- if statements have the same structure as function definitions: a header followed by an
indented body. Statements like this are called compound statements.

## Example
```
x=2
if x > 0:
    print('x is positive')
```

Output:
x is positive
